## General Information
About this Project: This project depicts the risk analytics in banking and financial services and how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. We will try to relate how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

Background: This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

Business Problem and Objective: The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 



## Technologies Used
- pandas - version 1.3.4
- numpy- version 1.20.3
- seaborn- version 0.11.2




## Conclusions
- Prefer applicants with higher experience
- Prefer accounts with no bankruptcy and less recent delinquency 
- Respectively, prefer accounts with lower dti
- Not to consider House Ownership Status
- With higher experience, income verification can be ignored.
